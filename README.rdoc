== Welcome to Jikan

Jikan is a time-tracking application built in Rails, designed to
be suitable for small groups that need to track users, clients,
projects, hours, invoices, and payments.  It's not designed to
do everything -- in fact, it may become an engine at some point.

Pull requests welcomed!
